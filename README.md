# Codebase of the [BITSkrieg Website](https://github.com/probablyliquid/BITSkrieg-Website)

- Find .jsx and .css files in 'src' folder
- App.css contains the styling for all the components
- Components are listed under 'src/components'
- I've used Vite+React for this.
- I've used 'react-scroll' module.

### Instructions
- Clone this repo to get it on your local machine
- Initialise you local dev environment.
- You might need:
- ```npm run install``` To install dependencies
- ```npm install 'react-scroll'``` To install react-scroll
- ```npm run dev``` To set up local dev server 
- ```npm run build``` To build the vite app (You don't really need this if you're satisfied with dev server)
- ```npm run preview``` To view the build preview (Again, you don't need this) 
- You don't need to build for this to work. The build command is run at deployment by default.
