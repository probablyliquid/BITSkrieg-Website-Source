# Codebase of the [BITSkrieg Website](https://github.com/probablyliquid/BITSkrieg-Website)

- Find .jsx and .css files in 'src' folder
- App.css contains the styling for all the components
- Components are listed under 'src/components'
- I've used Vite+React for this.
- I've used 'react-scroll' module.
- Build your files to the 'dist' folder and deploy them
